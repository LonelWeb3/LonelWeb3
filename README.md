- 👋 Hi, I’m @LonelWeb3, normal worker during the day and crypto-fan outside of work. 
- 👀 I’m interested in cryptos, Web3, NFTs and what the future will be built upon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the most up-to-date techstack for Dapps development on the back-end : Solidity for Smart contracts, Hardhat as a environment (as well as Brownie), Ethers.js (or corresponding Web3.py) to interact with the EVM, and React to create user-friendly interfaces.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projets from NFTs to DeFi protocols as a Smart contracts developer.
- 📫 How to reach me : you can write to my telegram @NeloGE
